## 🎯 Project Overview

What: PDFMaster - WordPress pay-per-action PDF processing app
Business Model: $0.99 per file processed (no subscriptions, no credits)
Tech Stack: WordPress + Elementor Pro + Stirling PDF + Stripe
Goal: MVP with compress tool, working payment flow

Repository: https://github.com/zurychhh/pdfmaster-wp
Branch: main (active feature branch: feature/pay-per-action-99)
Last PR: #7 — Pay‑per‑action + payment modal fixes (OPEN)

## 📚 Documentation Structure

Root Level (Quick Access)

- README.md - Quick start, project basics, links to all docs
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - Current state, architecture, next tasks

User Documentation (docs/user/)

- ELEMENTOR_EDITING_GUIDE.md - How to edit site via Elementor UI (self-service)
- ELEMENTOR_STRUCTURE_MAP.md - Page structure map with widget types

Historical Records (docs/)

- session_notes/ - Work logs from each session (SESSION_NOTES_YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- archive/ - Completed phase documentation (e.g., AUDIT_RESULTS.md)

Purpose:

- For Droids: PROJECT_STATUS.md = comprehensive current state
- For Users: docs/user/ = self-service editing (no Droid needed)
- For Team: session_notes/ = decision history and context

Maintenance:

- PROJECT_STATUS.md updated every session (living document)
- User guides updated only when structure changes
- Session notes created at end of each work session
- Archive old docs when phases complete

## 📈 Status Update — 2025-10-15

Completed recently
- Pay-per-action model finalized ($0.99) — merged PRs #7, #8, #9
- UX Polish Phase 1 — spinner, clearer errors, payment UI cleanup — merged PR #10
- UX Polish Phase 2 (compression level selector; before/after file size) — PR #11 opened
- Landing page conversion fixes (hero navbar height, trust badges, hero tools row, secondary button styling) — PR #12 opened
- Elementor Self‑Service (Phase 1: Audit & Docs) — PR #13 opened
  - ELEMENTOR_EDITING_GUIDE.md (how to edit everything via Elementor UI)
  - ELEMENTOR_STRUCTURE_MAP.md (full hierarchy + widget types)
  - docs/AUDIT_RESULTS.md (inventory + actions)

Editor = Front parity
- Rolled back JS auto‑injection in hero to avoid editor/front mismatch
- Inserted hero trust badges/tools into page content (shortcodes) as stop‑gap
- Next: convert shortcodes/HTML to native Elementor widgets (Icon List/Icon Box/Price Table) for 100% self‑service

Open PRs
- None — latest work merged (#14, #15)

Working style (process)
- Droid executes end‑to‑end (plan → implement → commit → PR → validate) with minimal back‑and‑forth
- You provide only privileged inputs (e.g., API keys) or approvals
- Rule: all visual content must remain 100% editable in Elementor; avoid code‑only content
- Use .pdfm-* CSS classes; prefer native Elementor widgets over HTML

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Payment Flow
1) User uploads PDF → processes via Stirling
2) Backend returns download_token (unique, unpaid)
3) Frontend shows "Pay $0.99 to Download" button
4) Button opens payment modal (Stripe Elements)
5) PaymentIntent created with file_token in metadata
6) User enters card → payment succeeds
7) Backend marks token as paid in database
8) Download button activates
9) Download endpoint verifies token payment before streaming file

Security: Token-based gating, server-side verification, no client-side bypass

### Stirling PDF Integration
- Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/misc/compress-pdf
- Method: POST multipart/form-data
- Required fields:
  - fileInput: PDF file
  - optimizeLevel: 5 (1–9)
  - expectedOutputSize: 25KB
  - linearize: false
  - normalize: false
  - grayscale: false

### Stripe Configuration
- Mode: Test
- Keys in: WP Admin → Settings → PDFMaster Payments

## 🔄 Recent Changes (What Changed)

### Payment Model Simplification
Before: 3 credits for $2.90 with user accounts
After: $0.99 per action, no credits, no accounts

Changed files:
- class-stripe-handler.php: amount 290 → 99; metadata includes file_token
- class-processor.php: removed credit checks; download verifies paid token
- payment-modal.js: simplified messaging and flow using file_token

### Stirling API Fix
Before: Wrong endpoint causing 404
After: Correct endpoint /api/v1/misc/compress-pdf with required params

### Payment Modal Fix
Before: Stripe.js not loading, modal not opening
After: Proper script loading order, event handlers working

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

Minor UI Issue
- Description: After payment success, some buttons (cancel/download under main content) don't refresh
- Impact: LOW — user can still download via primary button
- Fix: Will be addressed in UX polish task
- Status: Backlogged

## 💡 Development Notes

Factory.ai Workflow
- Default: Single Droid (90% of cases)
- Multi-Droid only if: task > 6h, independent components, zero overlap, >30% time savings

Code Standards
- WordPress-compatible code, clear structure
- Explicit require/include where applicable

Testing Protocol
- Always test E2E after major changes
- Use real PDFs (not tiny dummies)
- Verify Stripe test payment; confirm record in Stripe Dashboard
